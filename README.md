# node-red-contrib-hs100

This Node-RED node is for controlling tp-link Wi-Fi Smart Plug - Model HS100.

This node has only been tested with a HS100(UK). The HS100 is also available in US and EU plug versions. We expect they will work too.

This node simply wraps the excellent work here https://github.com/czjs2/hs100-api.
